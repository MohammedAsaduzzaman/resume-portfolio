<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    Along with being a full time dad, I love watching sports. I'm a huge Cowboys and Mavericks fan.
    My kids take up most of my time and I love every minute with them. They're so fun. 
    But occasionally, I have to inject myself with sports. I've been a fan of my Dallas teams since 2003.
    It has been my getaway. My favorite players are shown within each logo. Take a look!
